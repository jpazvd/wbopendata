    Description: Gross domestic product is the total income earned through
    the production of goods and services in an economic territory during an
    accounting period. It can be measured in three different ways: using
    either the expenditure approach, the income approach, or the production
    approach. The core indicator has been divided by the general population
    to achieve a per capita estimate.This indicator is expressed in constant
    prices, meaning the series has been adjusted to account for price
    changes over time. The reference year for this adjustment is 2015. This
    indicator is expressed in United States dollars.
